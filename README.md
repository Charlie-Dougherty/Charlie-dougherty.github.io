## AI Tools

### [Advanced Cursor AI Techniques](ai-tools/advanced-cursor-techniques.md) - 2025-02-28

Discovered that I've been using Cursor AI inefficiently. The key is to break problems into smaller, well-defined tasks rather than asking for complete solutions all at once.

### [Machine Coding Protocols (MCPs) Basics](ai-tools/mcp-basics.md) - 2025-02-28

Learned about MCPs as a standardized way for humans to communicate with AI coding assistants. Started exploring Goose and OpenHands repos to understand their implementation.

---

## Rust

### [Rust Type System Advantages with LLMs](rust/type-system-llm-advantages.md) - 2025-02-28

Discovered why Rust's type system is particularly well-suited for working with LLMs. The strict typing helps AI generate more accurate and safer code.

---

## CI/CD

### [Setting Up a Basic CI Pipeline](ci-cd/basic-pipeline-setup.md) - 2025-02-28

Learned how to set up a simple CI pipeline using CircleCI. Configured it to run tests automatically on every commit.

---

## Testing

### [Introduction to Property-Based Testing](testing/property-based-testing-intro.md) - 2025-02-28

Explored the concept of property-based testing and how it differs from example-based testing. Understood how it can find edge cases I wouldn't think to test.

---

## Git

### [Git from First Principles](git/first-principles.md) - 2025-02-28

Started learning Git from first principles rather than just memorizing commands. Understanding the object model and how commits form a directed acyclic graph.

---

## Product Engineering

### [Connecting Code to Business Value](product-engineering/code-to-business-value.md) - 2025-02-28

Learned frameworks for evaluating how specific engineering work translates to business outcomes. Considering metrics beyond just technical excellence.

## About

I'm documenting my learning journey as I develop skills for the AI-driven future of software engineering. This TIL collection is inspired by Geoffrey Huntley's advice and Simon Willison's [TIL repository](https://github.com/simonw/til).
